# Jadin Wilkening

I'm Jadin — a creative technologist who thinks like an engineer but dreams like an artist. I’ve always been someone who blurs the lines between left brain and right brain, and I’m most at home when I’m building tools that bring ideas to life — especially in animation, design, and storytelling.

I code like I choreograph: with intention, rhythm, and a deep respect for the process. Whether it’s building a custom CLI tool to organize animation projects or developing a website from scratch that feels like *me*, I care about making things that are both functional and expressive.

### Right now, I’m:
- Preparing my portfolio to share at SIGGRAPH
- Learning Pixar’s RenderMan and diving deeper into technical artistry
- Creating tools that support creative pipelines (check out Pipeline Pal!)
- Always chasing the sweet spot between structure and storytelling

### A few things I’ve made:
**[Pipeline Pal](https://github.com/jadinwilkening/my-pipeline-pal)**  
A command-line tool that helps animators and artists stay organized while logging progress — born from my own need for clarity in creative chaos.

**[jadinwilkening.com](https://www.jadinwilkening.com)**  
A personal website I coded from scratch to showcase everything I do — from dev work and performance to design and story. (Still evolving, like me.)

If you’re someone who sees the beauty in both source code and sketchbooks — or just want to nerd out about RenderMan, animation pipelines, or story-driven tech — let’s connect.
